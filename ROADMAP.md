# OR-Testbed Development Roadmap

The main objective of OR-Testbed is to provide a complete suite of the main state of the 
art metaheuristics, that does not necessarily mean to implement all the existing ones.

This document shows current work and possible future work, so that contributions are organized 
and do not overlap.

**Note #2**: For more information about the metaheuristics and techniques mentioned in this document, 
please refer to the docs section, as it may be covered there.

**Note #2**: At some point in the future, this information will be translated into an application that allows it to be handled 
more efficiently.

## Ready to use

* GRASP constructive version (basic and multistart approach)
* Simulated Annealing method (basic and multistart approach)
* Tabu Search (basic and multistart approach)


## On development

### Metaheuristic

### Techniques

## Future 

### Metaheuristic

* Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) 
* Genetic algorithms base (GA)

### Techniques

* Path relinking 


## Contributing

All contributions will be greatly appreciated. Keep in mind that there is no need to implement
every metaheuristic ever proposed. However, feel free to propose or implement anything you see
useful or that have served in your work.
