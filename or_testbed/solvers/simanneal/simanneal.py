    """
        Simulated Annealing implementation.

        Based on Kirkpatricks work, this solver takes an initial solution and tries to improve it. It cannot create a new solution.

        Basically, simulated annealing uses an inspiration between the annealing process in metals and some topics in combinatorial optimization.
        The algorithm defines the space solution in terms of a neighborhood, and explores solutions modifying small parts of a solution.
        Then, the new solution is compared to the last one, if it is an improvement, new solution is accepted. If not, it's discarded.

        However, to avoid getting stuck in local optimal solutions, some worse solutions may be accepted (this is were the cooling parameter of the algorithm sets the probability of accepting a worse movement).

        In this algorithm, the developer needs to implement his own set of movements, everything else of the logic of the algorithm is already implemented.

        Check examples folder to see how to define and interact with simulated annealing.
