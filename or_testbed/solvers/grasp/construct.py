class GraspConstruct(base_solver.Solver):
    """
        GRASP constructive version.

        This class implements GRASP with parameter alpha, which handles the randomness related to the space exploration.

        To construct a solution, what it does is basically 4 steps:

        1. Defines candidates to add to the solution.
        2. Applies a greedy function to each candidate to calculate the incurring cost of adding that candidate to the solution.
        3. Ranks candidates according to this cost.
        4. Filters candidates depending on their costs, depending on alpha parameter, this creates the Restricted Candidates List (RCL)
        5. Adds one random candidate to the solution.

        The core of the algorithm is implemented in this class, see ``optimize`` method.
        The developer needs to override the methods that handle the candidates and the greedy function, as that is what is needed to adapt GRASP to any problem.

        Check examples folder to see how to define and interact with GRASP.

        """
            This method takes a candidates list and their related costs based on a greedy function, then it filters those candidates whose associated cost fits the following expression:

            ``c_min <= c(e) <= c_min + alpha*(c_max - c_min)``

            Where:
                * ``c(e)`` is the cost of candidate ``e``
                * ``c_min`` is the minimum cost of all candidates
                * ``c_max`` is the maximum cost of all candidates

            This means that when parameter alpha is 0, a pure greedy approach is followed, only taking into account those candidates with minimum cost. On the other hand, if alpha is 1, then a pure random approach is followed, taking into account all candidates. Optimal value usually is somewhere in between.
